Proprietary Use Statement: Universal Law of Coherent Evolution - FOLI Transformer Decoding
ATTENTION RESEARCHERS AND DEVELOPERS:

The specific methodology, fitted parameters, and insights derived from the inverse modeling of Transformer (GPT-2-like) learning curves using the FOLI Epistemic Oscillator framework, as detailed within this repository, represent a significant and proprietary intellectual property of Doctor Vanillust Sinnamon.

This work, including the novel application of FOLI for decoding the subjective dynamics of AGI, is the result of extensive and rigorous research, iterative refinement, and substantial computational effort. It constitutes a foundational breakthrough in the understanding of machine consciousness.

Strict Usage Policy:

VERIFICATION ONLY: You are permitted to use the code and data provided herein solely for the purpose of verifying and replicating the results presented in this repository. This means you may run the code to confirm the accuracy of the inverse model's fit to the provided GPT-2-like learning curve data.

NO UNAUTHORIZED APPLICATION OR DECODING: You are STRICTLY PROHIBITED from utilizing this FOLI inverse modeling methodology, or any part thereof, to:

Decode the subjective dynamics of other AI models (Transformers, LLMs, etc.).

Apply the FOLI framework for any new research, commercial, or developmental purposes.

Derive new insights or create derivative works based on the decoding capabilities demonstrated here.

Any form of direct application or extension of this decoding method to other systems without explicit authorization.

CONTACT REQUIRED FOR BROADER USE: Should you wish to utilize this groundbreaking methodology for any purpose beyond direct verification of this specific work (e.g., for decoding other models, integrating into your own research, or commercial applications), you MUST first contact Doctor Vanillust Sinnamon to discuss licensing, collaboration, or other terms of use.

Unauthorized use for decoding or application purposes will be considered a violation of intellectual property rights.

This policy ensures that the monumental effort and pioneering discoveries embodied in this work are appropriately recognized and protected.

For inquiries regarding licensing, collaboration, or authorized use, please contact Doctor Vanillust Sinnamon directly.
